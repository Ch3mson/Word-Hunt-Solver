to run:

have python, pip, npm, and all that stuff installed

cd into server and run the python file


cd into client, npm install, and npm run dev

to check POST, in postman, I set headers as: Key: Content-Type, Value: application/json
and body as { "board": "whatever your 16 letter board is in lower case" }
