A word hunt solver created with Next.js and Flask. All computations are done with the Trie data structure, which optimizes finding all valid combinations of words in a 4x4 grid from 8 seconds of brute force to less than 1 second when searching through the english dictionary. When making this project, I noticed that all the available webistes have outdated UI and none of them use the latest web frameworks, hence I created this app. This solver will also be useful to beat my friends.
